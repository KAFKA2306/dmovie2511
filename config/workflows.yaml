  wan_crowded_crosswalk:
    prompt: Overhead crane shot descending toward a bustling midday crosswalk in Tokyo Shibuya. Camera starts elevated capturing geometric pedestrian crossing lines then smoothly pans right following diverse commuters as they navigate the intersection. Glistening pavement reflects scattered puddles from light rain creating mirror surfaces. Soft diffused daylight filters through thin clouds casting even illumination with volumetric haze. Teal-and-orange color grade with shallow depth of field bokeh on background neon signs. Anamorphic lens with organic motion blur. Urban cinematic atmosphere with high contrast and crisp details capturing fabric textures and reflective surfaces.

  wan_mountain_expedition:
    prompt: Wide drone sweep ascending from snow-covered alpine ridge at golden hour sunrise. Camera tracks three climbers coordinating rope systems across jagged peaks with ice axes glinting in warm amber light. Cold tones dominate with pink-orange rim lighting on distant summits. Volumetric fog rolls through valleys below creating dramatic depth layers. Shot on 16mm film with subtle grain and bleach-bypass color treatment. Crisp high-altitude atmosphere with sharp focus on climbers transitioning to soft bokeh on background mountain ranges. Low angle perspective emphasizing scale and isolation. Cinematic composition with wide aspect ratio capturing epic wilderness grandeur and human determination against vast natural elements.

  wan_modern_lab:
    prompt: Dolly-in tracking shot through a sleek modern research laboratory with floor-to-ceiling glass panels. Camera glides past collaborative scientists calibrating advanced assistive robotics on a central workbench. Interactive holographic displays float in mid-air projecting blue-cyan data visualizations. Three-point lighting with soft key from overhead LED panels and cool rim light defining subject edges. Shallow depth of field isolates foreground activity while background equipment blurs into cinematic bokeh. Clean minimal aesthetic with white surfaces and chrome accents. Smooth gimbal stabilization keeps the horizon level. Futuristic atmosphere with volumetric light shafts cutting through controlled environment. Professional color grade with neutral base tones and saturated accents on holographic elements.

  wan_cultural_festival_night:
    prompt: Slow crane shot rising through a lantern-lit cultural festival courtyard at dusk. Camera starts low capturing families and elders sharing traditional food at wooden tables then elevates revealing layers of glowing paper lanterns suspended overhead. Warm tungsten light from lanterns creates golden bokeh spheres with anamorphic flare. Soft diffused illumination on faces with gentle rim light separating subjects from background. Rich color palette emphasizing warm oranges and reds contrasted with cool twilight blue sky. Shallow focus keeps foreground sharp while background festivities dissolve into dreamy bokeh. Organic handheld accents suggest intimate documentary style. Nostalgic atmosphere with film grain emulation and lifted shadows, celebrating intergenerational connection and cultural heritage.

  wan_urban_cyclist_morning:
    prompt: Dynamic handheld gimbal tracking shot following an energetic cyclist commuting through sunrise city streets. Camera maintains pace beside the rider capturing motion blur streaks on background vehicles and architecture. Golden hour side light rakes across building facades creating dramatic contrast and long shadows. Teal-and-orange grade balances warm highlights with cool shadows. Shallow depth of field keeps the cyclist crisp while the urban environment blurs into kinetic bokeh. Low angle emphasizes speed and forward momentum. Volumetric haze from morning mist diffuses sunlight into atmospheric shafts. Modern cinematic lens with controlled breathing and organic focus transitions. High contrast treatment preserves texture in reflective metals and fabric details.

  wan_coastal_research_vessel:
    prompt: Steady jib shot starting wide on a research vessel silhouette against twilight ocean horizon then smoothly descending to deck level. Marine scientists in technical gear deploy sensor equipment over the railing into bioluminescent waters creating glowing turquoise wake trails. Cool blue-hour lighting with magenta-cyan palette and deep teal water tones. Soft natural light from the fading sunset provides gentle rim light on subjects while practical deck lights add warm accents. Cinematic composition with rule-of-thirds framing and negative space emphasizing isolation at sea. Controlled camera movement with inertial dampening maintains smooth glide. Shallow focus on foreground scientists with background horizon dissolving into soft bokeh. Atmospheric haze and salt spray deliver volumetric depth and documentary authenticity.
